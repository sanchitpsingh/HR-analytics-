# Project Overview

The HR Analytics Dashboards project aims to leverage various data visualization and analysis tools to provide meaningful insights into HR data. By analyzing key HR metrics, such as job satisfaction, attrtion rates, education, and age, these dashboards can assist HR professionals in making informed decisions and identifying areas for improvement.

# What I Did
In this project, I developed a set of HR analytics dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and SQL. I gathered HR data from various sources, cleaned and transformed it using SQL queries and Excel functions, and then visualized the data using Power BI and Tableau. The dashboards cover a wide range of HR metrics, including employee demographics, performance analysis, attrition rates, and department analysis. Each dashboard provides interactive visualizations and filters to allow users to explore the data and gain actionable insights.

# Tools Used
* Power BI: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
* Tableau: Utilized for developing additional dashboards and visualizations.
* Excel: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
* SQL: Employed for querying and manipulating the HR data.

# What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with HR analytics and learned several valuable skills, including:

* Data cleaning and transformation techniques using SQL and Excel.
* Creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards in Power BI and Tableau.
* Analyzing HR metrics such as job satisfaction, attrition rates, education, age, and marital status etc.
* Leveraging different data visualization and analysis tools to derive insights from HR data.

This project also enhanced my understanding of HR-related challenges and provided practical solutions for decision-making within the HR department.
